       Ep. 24: Case Study: Release Notes
      </h3> 
      <p><em>Published on: July 30, 2021</em></p>

      <p>
       In this episode we interviewed Beatriz Guerreiro, fellow tech writer at VTEX, to talk about release notes, and the process of implementing them at VTEX. Bia graduated in International Relations at Universidade Federal Fluminense, in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, and before joining VTEX she worked at IBM in the Latin American HR. And we’re trying out a different kind of episode. On the last couple of weeks we came to the conclusion that it would be really cool to share with you a recent challenge we faced at VTEX involving release notes. We wanted to share how it went down and what we learned in the process. And it brought to my mind that maybe this could be a recurrent theme on the show. What if we had themed episodes with case studies of projects that different people lead? Tell us what you think!

        In this episode we interviewed <b>Maria Beatriz Vilela</b>, marketing specialist at Imovision, the film distributor. We’ll be covering a digital product that has been on my wish list for ages: streaming platforms! Maria Beatriz led the launch of Imovision’s first streaming platform, so we’ll talk specifically about film distribution, and how marketing content applies to this media. We dive deep about the insides of the movie industry, and how tech writing can be a part of other professionals' day to day - even though they are not aware of it!

      <p><em>Published on: June 2, 2021</em></p>

      <p>
        In this episode, we interviewed <b>Bruno Amui</b>, tech writing lead at VTEX. We covered two main topics: the first one, we like to call “how Bruno performs his tech sorcery” which is basically his analytical approach to solving any problem or bug - which will interest you, even if you don't work with documentation; and secondly, we’ll talk about hiring and training tech writers for roles that demand more technical backgrounds.  On the previous episode, we talked about the decisions around platforms and tools that tech writers use to create and host documentation. Listen to part one and two to get the full experience!
        
        <br> Bruno mentions <a target="_blank" href="https://nebulas.sfwa.org/">The Nebula Awards</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.thehugoawards.org/">The Hugo Awards</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://hackaday.com/">Hackaday</a> blog.</br>

        In this episode we cover tech writing and documentation platforms and tools. We interviewed <b>Bruno Amui</b>, tech writing lead at VTEX, talking about Bruno's surprising career path, where he jumped from building hardware, robots, and even satellites, to leading a tech writing team at VTEX.

<br>And spoiler alert: this is another episode where the chat was so inspiring that we didn't want to leave anything out, so our next episode will feature the rest of our interview, where we'll cover what we like to call "how Bruno performs his tech sorcery" since he can fix literally any problem or bug that we face. We'll also talk about leading a team of tech writers on our next episode, so stay tuned and listen to both parts to get the full experience.</br>

        In this episode we interview <b>John A Paz</b>, senior content designer at Menlo Security. Our chat with John was so inspiring to us that we just had to share the full conversation with you. And to improve your podcasting experience we split it into two episodes. So today you'll listen to part two, where he dives deep into the reality of the tech market for writers, and how we have a long way until we reach racial equality and inclusion. We also talk about how mentoring and training junior tech writers can be key into transforming lives and the market.  

<br>On part one, we explore John’s career, his experience in tech writing at Atlassian and Menlo, illustrated with his real day to day challenges, and how tech writing can be a great entry point for people interested in joining the tech market.</br>

        In this episode we chatted with <b>George Brindeiro</b>, who is the head of VTEX's Education team. Our chat was so insightful we didn’t want to keep any details out, so we actually split our conversation into two episodes. On part two we dive deep into our experience with tech writing, illustrating our chat with lots of real cases that happen in our day to day work, our team rituals that make us grow personally and as a team, and how we deal with our documentation challenges. So listen to parts 1 and 2 to get the full experience.

        In this episode we cover a very special subject for us: UX Writing with <b>Torrey Podmajersky</b>. Torrey's the author of the best-seller book Strategic Writing for UX and is currently a UX writer and content strategy consultant for Google. She's built an inspiring career getting involved in the most varied spaces, from high school teaching, to  fiction writing, and content strategy for numerous organizations. We started off by talking about her career, followed by the universe of UX writing itself, and of course, its application in the tech industry and digital products. We close our chat by discussing her amazing book that is definitely a major reference in the field.<br><br>We are both from Brazil, and some times a few Brazilian memes or expressions end up slipping past us, during the interviews. To comment on the one at 58:40'':<br><br>Whenever brazilians want to say that they joined or started something way before it was hyped, or well developed, we say "when I first came here, everything was just made up of grass/undergrowth". Meaning, nothing was built yet, everything was still green. Any brazilian listeners out there who agree with our translation?

        processes, web design practices, as well as the collaboration with tech
        and UX writers. We balanced our conversation between practical advices for

        In this episode, we had the pleasure of interviewing
        <strong>Mary K. Nielsen</strong>, UX Content Strategist at Mailchimp.
        Balancing philosophical aspects of Tone and Voice, but also giving
        practical guidance, we discussed how to build a company’s personality
        inside and outside digital products using this essential writing
        principle. Mailchimp is definitely a key reference when it comes to Tone
        and Voice within a company’s communication strategy, and we had a chance
        to understand how its own T&amp;V was built.
