      <p><em>Published on: June 2, 2021</em></p>

      <p>
        In this episode, we interviewed <b>Bruno Amui</b>, tech writing lead at VTEX. We covered two main topics: the first one, we like to call “how Bruno performs his tech sorcery” which is basically his analytical approach to solving any problem or bug - which will interest you, even if you don't work with documentation; and secondly, we’ll talk about hiring and training tech writers for roles that demand more technical backgrounds.  On the previous episode, we talked about the decisions around platforms and tools that tech writers use to create and host documentation. Listen to part one and two to get the full experience!

Torrey's the author of the best-seller book Strategic Writing for UX and is currently a UX writer and content strategy consultant for Google. She's built an inspiring career getting involved in the most varied spaces, from high school teaching, to  fiction writing, and content strategy for numerous organizations. We started off by talking about her career, followed by the universe of UX writing itself, and of course, its application in the tech industry and digital products. We close our chat by discussing her amazing book that is definitely a major reference in the field.<br><br>We are both from Brazil, and some times a few Brazilian memes or expressions end up slipping past us, during the interviews. To comment on the one at 58:40'':<br><br>Whenever brazilians want to say that they joined or started something way before it was hyped, or well developed, we say "when I first came here, everything was just made up of grass/undergrowth". Meaning, nothing was built yet, everything was still green. Any brazilian listeners out there who agree with our translation?
